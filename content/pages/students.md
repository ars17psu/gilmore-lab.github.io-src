# For Students

The Brain Development Lab, part of the [Psychology Department](http://psych.la.psu.edu) at Penn State, is looking for research assistants to study brain development in infants, children, and adolescents for **Fall 2015**. You can earn research project (PSY 494) credit or work study funds, and learn video, computer, and communication skills. Prior research experience and computer skills are a plus, but aren't required. We are especially interested in students who have morning availability, computer skills, or are interested in developing skills in advertising, marketing, or public relations.
